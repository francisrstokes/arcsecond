# Tutorial Part 2: Extracting useful information

[Back to part 1](./tutorial-part-1.md)

**Goal**: To understand how to extract, shape, and transform the parsed data.

[In the previous part](./tutorial-part-1), we created a simple parser to process weather data. The final result was the following array:

```javascript
[ 'Weather', ' ', [ '(', 'today', ')' ], ': ', 'Sunny' ]
```

This result contains all the information in a structured form, but still far more information than we actually need. Instead, it would be great to get a result like:

```javascript
{
  weather: 'Sunny',
  time: 'today'
}
```

arcsecond provides different ways to process data as it is being parsed. Let's take a look at one of those ways in isolation before getting back to the weather example.

## Mapping

```javascript
const {
  letters,
} = require('arcsecond');

const finalParser = letters.map(result => {
  return {
    data: result
  }
});

finalParser.run('hello').result
// -> { data: 'hello' }
```

Here the parser is extremely simple; it uses the `letters` parser to capture any characters *[a-zA-Z]*, and then uses the the `.map` method to transform the result into a structured object. `.map` works a lot like it does for an array - it allows you to run a function on the *value inside the parser* (when it is eventually run, of course!). It can be used with any parser, and most importantly, the result of mapping is still an other parser, which means it can be further composed!

## Coroutines

The next example is perhaps the most powerful tool in the arcsecond library, not only because of how expressive it is, but because the idea of *contextual parsing* falls out of it for free. The `coroutine` parser takes a generator function  [(if you don't know what that is take a look at this link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*), and allows parsing data using the yield keyword.

```javascript
const {
  letters,
  coroutine,
  char
} = require('arcsecond');

const fullParser = coroutine(function* () {
  const firstWord = yield letters;

  yield char(' ');

  const secondWord = yield letters;

  return {
    type: 'word list',
    words: [
      firstWord.toUpperCase(),
      secondWord.toUpperCase()
    ]
  };
});

fullParser.run('hello world').result
// -> { type: 'word list', words: ['HELLO', 'WORLD'] }
```

As you can see from the example above, `coroutine` can be used to both express sequences of parsing operations and data transformations, in this case replacing both the need to use `sequenceOf` and `.map`. It also allows us to implicitly throw away information we need to parse but don't need to keep, like the space character. As a final note, a generator function can use all the regular features of JavaScript such as loops, if statements, multiple return paths, etc. This can allow for parsing the next piece of text differently, based on what was previously parsed. This power can also be downfall - sometimes it's clearer to just use a simpler parser!

## Rewriting the weather data parser

There are a couple of changes that would already improve this parser a lot. Let's rewrite it using `coroutine`s and `.map`s

```javascript
const {
  str,
  coroutine,    // +replaced sequenceOf
  choice,
  char,
} = require('arcsecond');

const weatherString = str('Weather');

const timeString = coroutine(function* () {
  // Parse and ignore '('
  yield char('(');

  // Parse and store the time string
  const time = yield choice([
    str('today'),
    str('yesterday'),
    str('one week ago')
  ]);

  // Parse and ignore ')'
  yield char(')');

  return time;
});

const weatherType = choice([
  str('Sunny'),
  str('Cloudy'),
  str('Rainy')
]);

const fullParser = coroutine(function* () {
  // Parse the weather string and the space character
  yield weatherString;
  yield char (' ');

  // Store the time string for later
  const time = yield timeString;

  // Parse and ignore the separator
  yield str (': ');

  // Store the weather string
  const weather = yield weatherType;

  // Return the data in a structured way
  return {
    time: time,
    weather: weather
  }
});

fullParser.run('Weather (today): Sunny').result
//  -> { time: 'today', weather: 'Sunny' }
```

Now we've thrown away all the useless information and only got what we really care about, in a data structure we've defined.

The parser is still a little bit weak though, because we can't parse more interesting time strings like "two weeks ago" or "three days ago". We can easily add this support by writing a `complexTimeString` parser for it:

```javascript
const {
  str,
  coroutine,
  choice,
  char,
  letters   // +added
} = require('arcsecond');

// ...

// This parser will match data like:
// - ten minutes
// - nine hours
// - four days
const pluralTime = sequenceOf([
  letters,
  char(' '),
  choice([
    str('hours'),
    str('days'),
    str('weeks')
  ])
]).map(strings => strings.join(''));

const complexTimeString = sequenceOf([
  choice([
    str('one hour'),
    str('one day'),
    str('one week'),
    pluralTime
  ]),
  str(' ago')
]).map(strings => strings.join(''));

const timeString = coroutine(function* () {
  yield char ('(');

  const time = yield choice ([
    str ('today'),
    str ('yesterday'),
    complexTimeString
  ]);

  yield char (')');

  return time;
});

// ...
fullParser.run('Weather (three hours ago): Cloudy').result
//  -> { time: 'three hours ago', weather: 'Cloudy' }
```

Now we can handle more complex time strings. Notice that in the `complexTimeString` parser, it is just as expressive to use `sequenceOf` and `.map`, as opposed to a `coroutine`.

### Limitations

Of course in this example, something like "Weather (panda days ago): Sunny" is considered to be a valid string, because we don't have a parser for numbers spelled out as words. Implementing a parser to handle this case is left as an exercise for the reader!

## Summary

Parsers can extract and transform the data they parse using the `.map` method. `coroutines` can also be used to to capture sequences of data and process them all in one place, much like `async/await` does for promises in `async` functions.

## Next: Error handling

So far there has been no mention of error handling! [This will covered in the next section.](./tutorial-part-3.md)
